While working in UCLA's Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering with Professor [Scott Brandenberg](http://www.cee.ucla.edu/profile-brandenberg/) and Daily Lab Supervisor [Mandro Eslami](http://www.uclageo.com/eslami/index.html), one of our main focuses was analyzing the engineering properties of various soils, which are important to consider when establishing the foundation for a structure. In order to store this data more efficiently, we began working on the infrastructures for an online soil database so other geotechnical engineers would not have to go through researching for a soil's characteristics.
