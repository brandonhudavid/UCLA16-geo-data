While working with Professor Scott Brandenberg and GSI Mandro Eslami, one of our main focuses was analyzing the engineering properties of various soils, which are important to consider when establishing the foundation for a structure. In order to store this data more efficiently, we began working on the infrastructures for an online soil database so other geotechnical engineers would not have to go through researching for a soil's characteristics. <br>
